Facing Issues? Here’s How to Fix WhatsApp Web Connection Problems
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you're having trouble connecting or scanning the code, here are some helpful tips to get you back on track:

1. **Poor Internet Connection**  
   WhatsApp Web needs a solid internet connection on both your phone and computer. Make sure both devices are online. If you're having issues, try toggling between Wi-Fi and mobile data.

2. **QR Code Not Scanning**  
   Check that your phone's camera is functioning well. Give the lens a quick clean and hold your device steady while scanning the code at web.whatsapp.com.

3. **Outdated WhatsApp App**  
   If your WhatsApp app is outdated, it might not support the latest features of WhatsApp Web. Head over to the App Store or Play Store and update your app.

4. **Browser Compatibility Issues**  
   Some browsers might block certain scripts necessary for loading web.whatsapp.com. It’s best to use a modern browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Edge and give it another shot.

5. **Device Limit Reached**  
   WhatsApp has a limit on how many devices you can link. Check "Linked Devices" on your phone and remove any old sessions before trying to connect to WhatsApp Web again.

- Always log out from web.whatsapp.com when you're using a public or shared computer.
